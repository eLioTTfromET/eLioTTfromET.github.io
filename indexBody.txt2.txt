dawg, reincarnation?

i just woke up and i had the wild thought, what if there’s an animal that remembers its past life?

like every mouse knows how they were as humans and that’s their identity and then they become mouse and all the mice know “o yeah Deborah she was from South Africa and she died in a car accident she’s moved into my neighborhood recently!”

but the only humans that became mice were the ones who hated mice, so now they’re like “o well i guess it’s nice to officially meet you lil homie”

gaahhhahaha idz dtoo much humans wouldn’t be able to handle knowing that happens

becoming that exact thing you hate? oooosh how to handle that😵‍💫

If they knew…

I think some people wouldn’t know how to take it…

and maybe their life purpose would change…

since they knew what would happened when they die…

Society would be very different

that thing that they know would happen when they die wouldn’t happen anymore if they didn’t hate mice👀lol that would be so fried u become what u hate and the only way to escape reincarnation is to not hate anyone or anything or to hate very temporary things like vape cravings and twitches

That would make people think in some sort of god though 

Because your purpose is to not “hate” and to embrace and I feel like people would want to know who came up with that concept and who determines that 

i mean people think in a god already with the way the universe currently works as we understand it, like why does the sun orbit the moon? god. why is the earth perfect distance from the sun for life? god

Right but the fact that reincarnation is determined by who hates and who doesn’t would maybe make atheists believe in someone who determines the hate 

the hatred is determined by the person hating id think, or adjacent to that idea

So they would know 

and i guess the idea kinda implies it’s really really really hard not to hate anyone or anything or, more lightly put, find no frustration or nuisance or negative pull or whatever from anything

That would be hard for many
Especially people in power
But sucks for them 

LMAO that would piss off Putin and all them big gunned folks ohohoooo i think idzaa good ideaaa

Putin’s scientists go up to him and are like “dawg we found out that you actually become everything you hate most when you die” and Putin just scoffs and terminates him and says “mmm not what i want to hear who is next”
